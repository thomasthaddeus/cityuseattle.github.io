## Introduction

`VIM` **(Vi IMproved)** is a highly configurable and powerful text editor designed for efficient text editing. \
It is an enhanced version of the classic `vi` editor, originally developed for *Unix* systems. \

## Modes

VIM operates in several modes, primarily:

- **Normal mode (default)**: navigation and manipulation of text

- **Visual mode**: selection of text
- **Command-line mode**: execution of VIM commands
