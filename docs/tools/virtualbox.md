# Install VirtualBox on MacOS (No Apple Silicon Valley Support)

**If you're using Apple Silicon Valley, VirtualBox may not work well. Actually, you need to find alternatives.**

[Check if you're using Apple Silicon Valley]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/common/applem1.md %})

1. Open the [VirtualBox download page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), choose the latest version and click "OS X hosts"

2. Once you get the downloaded install package, click that and you will see the image below. Click that VirtualBox.pkg. In the next several steps, you would see some questions during the installation process. Just click "Allow", "Continue" and "Done". That's it.
