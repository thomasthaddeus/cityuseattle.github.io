# Basic **nano** Tutorial

**nano** is a simple, easy-to-use text editor in Unix based systems like Linux and MacOS. This tutorial will guide you through the basic use of **nano**. Using **nano** is fairly straightforward, but there are a few key points to remember. Note that in **nano**'s documentation and prompts, the `Ctrl` and `Alt` keys are sometimes referred to as `^` and `M`, respectively.

## Opening and creating files

To open or create a file, use the **nano** command followed by the name of the file:|

   ```bash
   **nano** filename.txt
   ```

## Writing and editing text

Once you've opened a file, you can simply start typing to write or edit text.

### Always save your changes

It's important to remember to save your work frequently, especially if you're making lots of changes.

To save your changes, press `Ctrl+O` (writeOut). **nano** will ask you to confirm the filename. Press Enter to confirm.

### Know how to exit

To exit **nano**, press `Ctrl+X` (eXit). If you want to quit **nano** and you've made changes, the program will ask you if you want to save your changes. Press `Y` for yes or `N` for no.

## Basic navigation

Here are some specific shortcuts for navigating through your text:

| Command       | Description                        |
