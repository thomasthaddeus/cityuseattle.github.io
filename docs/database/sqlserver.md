 4. To verify the SQL Server instance, click Windows + R and type services.msc, then click Ok. You should be able to see a SQL Server instance running. Make a note of the SQL Server instance that you just created.

    A SQL Server instance is a copy of the sqlservr.exe executable that runs as an operating system service.

# Import a sample database to Microsoft SQL Server

## AdventureWorks sample database backup copy

To get the OLTP downloads of AdventureWorks, go to this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15). You can choose any. In my example, I chose the `AdventureWorks2017.bak` version.

## Install to SQL Server

### Restore backup

Follow the steps below to restore a backup of your database using SQL Server Management Studio.

 1. Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the target SQL Server instance.

 2. Right-click on the Databases node, and select Restore Database.

    ![ssms_restore_db_page](/assets/images/sqlserver/ssms_restore_db_page.png)

 4. In the Select backup devices dialog, click Add, then navigate to the database backup in the filesystem of the server and select the backup. Click OK.

    ![ssms_select_backup_devices](/assets/images/sqlserver/ssms_select_backup_devices.png)

 5. If needed, change the target location for the data and log files in the Files pane. Note that it is a best practice to place data and log files on different drives.
