## Pre-knowledge

Version control system (VCS) is created to makes it easy to store different versions of the project you are working at any time (without any fixed rules, time or rules). You can easily restore an earlier record and compare the content with the current data to find the differences. In addition, it also an effective tool to cooperate with many other people in the same project. In this module, we will learn about one of the most popular VCS which is Git and GitHub.

First of all, Git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is a VCS while GitHub is a hosting server for software development version control. The way Git works is that it creates a **repository** to store each version of the project every time developers modify or add some features into the project. Developers use Git through terminal or command line.

However, Git only allows you to control your project version on your local machine. Therefore, if there are 2 or more people working on a same project, how do we connect the works of all the members? That is why we need a hosting server GitHub.
