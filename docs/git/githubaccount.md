## Pre-knowledge

Version control systems (VCS) were created to make it easy to store different versions of the project you are working at any time (without any fixed rules or time). You can easily restore an earlier record and compare the content with the current data to find the differences. In addition, VCS are also an effective tool to cooperate with many other people in the same project. In this section, we will learn about one of the most popular VCS which is Git and GitHub.

First of all, Git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is a VCS while GitHub is a hosting server used for software development version control. The way Git works is that it creates a **repository** to store each version of a project every time developers modify or add some features into the project. Developers can use Git through the terminal or command line.

However, Git only allows you to control your project version on your local machine. Therefore, if there are 2 or more people working on the same project, how can we connect the works of all the members? That is why we need a hosting server such as GitHub.
