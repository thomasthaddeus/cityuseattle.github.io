# A guide for HOP or HOS


This guide is for any courses' HOP (for undergraduates) or HOS (for graduates) that's on GitHub. The unique difference is the course number. I'll use 624 as the example to show you how to do your HOP or HOS (Please remember to use your correct course number instead of 624)

# Preparation

The **first thing** you need to consider is finding a place to store your HOP or HOS repositories. 

There is a [recommend way](../organization/) to organize your 10 week's course content. Please take a look and create those folders for the course.

# Clone or Download

In this part, you have 2 ways to clone GitHub repository to your local machine. The first one is `Git Command Line` and the other is `GitHub Desktop`. You can choose anyone you're comfortable with.

**Notice: If you have no experience with Git or GitHub, the GitHub Desktop would be better choice.**


### Git Command Line

In your local machine, open Terminal (for Mac) or Command Prompt (CMD for Windows), type the following commands clone(download the repository to your local machine)

**Don't have Git command?** Please follow [Install Git Command]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/git/install.md %}) to install it

* `cd {Your course path}/624/Module01` (Assume you're doing 1st week's HOP or HOS. cd Module02 if you're doing 2nd week's HOP or HOS)

* `git clone [URL]` (to download this Github repository to your local machine, **replace [URL] with the actual url of your repository**. Use the copy icon to copy the repository [URL].
