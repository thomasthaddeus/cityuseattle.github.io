# How to organize your HOP/HOS repository for class?

We have 10 weeks every quarter. For doing homework, we will always download files or clone repository from GitHub. A recommended file structure is included below. We will create 10 folders under the course - one for each week.

For example, we will create a folder for every course by course number. Every quarter has 10 weeks, so we create 10 folders following the "ModuleXX" convention.
