# Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values. Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables include:
* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
* A variable name cannot start with a number
* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _)
* Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

To create the variable type message = “Hello World” and run your python file.

Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line and you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line.
