# CityU TA Center

This project was initiated by Teaching Assistants (TAs) at the City University of Seattle (CityU), School of Computing & Technology (STC).
One of the main purposes of this project is to reduce the workload of the TAs and optimize the workflow of the TAs.

But the project isn't just limited to CityU. We are here to share technical knowledge and help you solve problems quickly. Also, we hope you can learn something from here as well.

This website is hosted on GitHub Pages and is open to anyone - not just CityU TAs.
